## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello ðŸ’Œ
This is my own repository. I want to learn GitHub so that I can animate mathematics. I expect this to be quite hard but I will try my best to learn.
I did take "Programming for Math" at UCSC in which we used github, but much of the code was provided to us. Now, I want to teach everything to myself.
Wish me luck
